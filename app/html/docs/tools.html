<h1>Flint Build Tools</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Flint build tools take care of quite a few tasks making it easy to build your application without the need to restart the server or recompile files while you're working. </p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how the basic components work to create an application:</p>
<img src="/images/flow-diagram.png" />
<p>The <a href="/docs/classes.html">core classes</a> are highlighted in blue. There are <strong>three primary languages</strong> used to construct Flint applications. 
  You should familiarize yourself with these languages before getting started:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://coffeescript.org">Coffeescript</a> is a language that compiles into Javascript with all sorts of syntax sugar.</li>
  <li><a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> is a "logicless" template language that keeps your templates clean.</li>
  <li><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> (not in the diagram) is a CSS compiler like LESS, SASS etc.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<h3>Using The Command Line Tool</h3>
<p>The command line tool will print a manual page by simply entering the <strong>flint</strong> command in your terminal. Here are the arguments explained in detail:<p>
<h4>--new (-n)</h4>  
<p>The new command creates a new Flint application. To start a new app type:</p>
<pre>
flint -n todos
</pre>
<p>Before you use the rest of the command line tools <strong>cd</strong> into your new application: </p>
<pre>
cd todos
</pre>
<h4>--server (-s)</h4>  
<p>The server command spins up an <a href="http://http://expressjs.com/">express server</a> instance which you can view in your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>
<pre>
flint -s
</pre>
<p style="font-size:11px">NOTE: You may have to install the <strong>request</strong> module globally even though it is part of express</p>
<h4>--watch (-w)</h4>  
<p>Watches all your application files and recompiles when changes are detected. This avoids having to recompile to see the result of your changes.</p>
<pre>
flint -w
</pre>
<p style="font-size:11px"><strong>Note:</strong> To watch changes to your Responder classes, you will also need to pass --server (-s) to the flint command.</p>
<h4>--quiet (-q)</h4>  
<p>This is a watch modifier which tells flint to only print compile errors to the console. By default, console messages are sent each time a change is detected to a file.</p>
<pre>
flint -wq
</pre>
<h4>--compile (-c)</h4>  
<p>Compiles client side files to their respective outputs once and completes without watching. Useful for quick changes to copy that may not require testing/viewing.</p>
<pre>
flint -c
</pre>
<h4>--package (-p)</h4>  
<p>Packages and compresses the "nice" compiled output into a single minified build target, "production.js" by default.</p>
<pre>
flint -p
</pre>
<h4>--file (-f) [file]</h4>  
<p>This argument allows you to specify a configuration file relative to the current working directory to be used in place of the flint.js file. 
  This is very handy for sharing application code and repositories between two desired outputs. (e.g. desktop vs. mobile)</p>
<pre>
flint -wsf flint-mobile-verion.js
</pre>
<h4>--build (-b)</h4>  
<p>This command takes compiles the core flint libraries into their targets. The only time this is used is when you require an existing application to use new flint core functionality.</p>
<pre>
flint -b
</pre>
